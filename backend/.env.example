# Backend environment variables (example)
# Copy this file to `.env` and fill real values. NEVER commit `.env` to git.

# Base API URL for external services (if used)
BASE_API_URL=https://api.langflow.astra.datastax.com

# Langflow / Astra placeholders (replace with your real IDs/tokens)
LANGFLOW_ID=your_langflow_id_here
FLOW_ID=your_flow_id_here
APPLICATION_TOKEN=your_astra_token_here

# Notes:
# - This example file should be committed, but the real `.env` must be kept out of source control.
# - The Flask backend in this project reads configuration from environment variables. Update as needed.
